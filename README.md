    What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this git repository is to document and store all the work done in Comp20, aka WebProgramming. It includes work from Assignments 1-The Portfolio, 2-The Front-end, 3-The Back-end, and 4-Security. It also includes the 9 labs.

    What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment is Assignment 2-The Front-end, or Not Uber's map. I really liked working with front-end stuff and Google Maps' API, and it gave me my first taste of having to really do the research and learn by myself. I also really like that you can immediately see the final product, unlike the back-end stuff. I also enjoyed the little bit of freedom it gave (I read it as No Tuber, so I made the other passengers potatoes, hah).

    How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think I've grown quite a bit. I'm still not amazing at doing my own research for a project, but this course definitely helped me practice that skill. 

    What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing I learned is to not be afraid of asking for help, even for seemingly simple things! I am terrible at this, but at a few points I had to because there was no moving forward unless I did. Once, I couldn't figure out what I knew was a dumb problem with a simple fix for the Google Maps API, so I had to ask a TA I'd never met for help. The solution was as simple as I'd expected; I just had to move one line of code outside the brackets. Another example is that I genuinely had no idea where to begin for the back-end assignment, so I put it off for as long as possible. All I really needed was to just ask a friend to talk it through with me, and from that I realized that if i could just break it into 3 chunks, it'd be more manageable.
    
    Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I'd personally really like to learn about front-end developing, and using frameworks such as Bootstrap and JS libraries such as jQuery, among others. I wish there was a class for front-end specifically, but, alas, there is not.
